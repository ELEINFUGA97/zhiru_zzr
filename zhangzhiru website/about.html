        <p>Zhiru Zhang, a printmaking artist, has been dedicated to the study of printmaking and has explored black and white imagery over the past few years. Printmaking is not only a means of expression but also a tool for exploring the boundaries between reality and void, light and shadow. I use delicate printmaking techniques to challenge the visual and psychological boundaries, exploring and expressing infinite emotions and stories through a minimalistic black-and-white color palette. This seemingly restrictive approach actually opens up vast creative possibilities, allowing me to tell complex stories and reveal intricate details and profound emotions of life through simple colors.</p>
